# ciphergame
a simple cipher game using python


This is a basic encrypt/decrypt application that uses a caesar cipher to encode or decode messages.

Created in Python 2.7, so you will need at least this version of Python installed on your machine.

To Run (Windows machine):
 - download zip or clone repo to your machine
 - enter ciphergame-master folder
 - right click on cipher.py
 - select 'Open With'
 - select 'python.exe'
 
 A command window will open up with the app running.
 
 Typing:
 - e will encrypt a message
 - d will decrypt a message
 - q will quit the application
 
 In all cases you can set the cipher, so once you have typed in your message you will be asked to set the key.
